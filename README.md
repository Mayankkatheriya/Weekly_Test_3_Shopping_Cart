## Explaination:

This code creates an e-commerce shopping cart webpage.

`HTML`:

* The HTML sets up a webpage with a container divided into two sections: "Products" and "Cart."
* It displays products (shirts, T-shirts, trousers) with their names, prices, and buttons to add or remove them from the cart.

`CSS`:

* The CSS defines the styling and layout of the webpage, including fonts, colors, and responsiveness.
* It provides an appealing background and styles for the product and cart sections.

`JavaScript`:

* The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the webpage.
* It allows users to add or remove products from the cart by clicking buttons.
* The cart updates in real-time and calculates the total amount.

In summary, this webpage provides a simple e-commerce experience where users can select products, add them to the cart, and see the total amount they need to pay. It has an attractive design and is responsive to different screen sizes.
